<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>How it works</title></HEAD><BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><H1></H1>How it works from a Web-designers point of wiew.<P>As a web designer you cant tweek you web (if you are using dir2toc) by following means:<OL><LI>Editing one single frame in the root of the web (or by creating several of them)<LI>editing the toc.cfg-file that exist in every directory in the directory tree<LI>And mainly by editing the  so called cfg-files</OL>For more information select on in the left frameby editing the files that arein a directory that is called configuration directory (or folder if you areusing a mac). This directory contains the following files:<PRE>	config.pl	dirUp.cfg	dirUpCurr.cfg	footer.cfg	head.cfg	itemLineDir.cfg	itemLineFile.cfg</PRE>2. You do not want web-designers messing with the script so you create   a directory for them containing templates for various parts of the    toc-file (its the same as $cfgDir). put your script somewhere safe   and let the-webdesgner only run it!3. Tell them what they can and cant do with theese files.table:</BODY></HTML>
