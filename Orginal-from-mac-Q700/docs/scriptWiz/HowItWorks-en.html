Figure out how the script works. note the way it handles my html-   templates and how the master-frame is relates to the tocFiles and   the content itself.2. You do not want web-designers messing with the script so you create   a directory for them containing templates for various parts of the    toc-file (its the same as $cfgDir). put your script somewhere safe   and let the-webdesgner only run it!3. Tell them what they can and cant do with theese files.</BODY></HTML>
