<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Docs for dir2toc</title></HEAD><BODY> This script creates a textbased navigational system for a frame-based web. The script goes through a directory tree and creates a file in every directory ($tocFile) which acts like a Table Of Contents. The idea is to  create and recreate theese files as batch jobs  so that you do not create extra load on the www-server every time someone requests a toc-file!!!! Therefor the name dir2toc  Actually it is my first actual "program", not counting html and  Javascript as "programs" (I do know that perl is not a programmming language  but a scripting language).  <PRE> 11-nov-97-Tjalle - project created ( I downloaded MacPerl) 12-nov-97-Tjalle - Trying to figure out how it works, borrowed                    the Camel (THE BOOK) from work. 13-nov-97-Tjalle - created OS-options (tested so far on Win and Mac) 14-nov-97-Tjalle - YES, it really goes into every folder on my mac 15-nov-97-Tjalle - At least it does the navigational links,                    even if it probably could be done more efficient. 15-nov-97-Tjalle - The filtering of files seems to work as they should 23-nov-97-Tjalle - Added Language filtering and splited the parameters                    into a separate file </PRE> Feel free to use it for free! in Helsinki late 1997  TjalleTo the details:1. Figure out how the script works. note the way it handles my html-   templates and how the master-frame is relates to the tocFiles and   the content itself.2. You do not want web-designers messing with the script so you create   a directory for them containing templates for various parts of the    toc-file (its the same as $cfgDir). put your script somewhere safe   and let the-webdesgner only run it!3. Tell them what they can and cant do with theese files.</BODY></HTML>
